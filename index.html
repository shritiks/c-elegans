    <p>
        This project is an interactive gene expression simulation for <i>C. elegans</i>, designed to explore how changes in gene expression affect behavior. 
        By manipulating expression levels of key genes, users can observe the impact on movement, feeding, and odor response.
    </p> 
    <p>
        My motivation for this project is to explore my passion for neurobiology through the lens of technology. 
        By integrating these fields, I aim to deepen my understanding while continuously discovering new aspects of this vast and evolving discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
        I suggest starting with the <i>C. elegans</i> page to familiarize yourself with the basic anatomy of this essential model organism in neurobiology and developmental biology.
        Next, explore the Behavioural Genes page to understand the genes you'll be manipulating.
        Finally, dive into the simulation and experiment with gene expression!
