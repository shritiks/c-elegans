    <i>unc-47</i>

  <div class="genes-text-left">
      <p>
        The <i>unc-47</i> gene in C. elegans is located on the X chromosome and encodes the Vesicular GABA Transporter (VGAT), which is essential for inhibitory neurotransmission. It is primarily expressed in GABAergic neurons, where it facilitates the packaging of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) into synaptic vesicles before release into the synapse. This process is crucial for regulating motor coordination and muscle relaxation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mutations in <i>unc-47</i> disrupt GABAergic signaling, leading to the uncoordinated (Unc) phenotype, characterized by hypercontraction, defective locomotion, and impaired behavioral responses. As a key neurobehavioral gene, <i>unc-47</i> provides critical insights into inhibitory neurotransmission, with implications for understanding GABAergic dysfunction in neurological disorders such as epilepsy and spasticity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Given its direct role in motor control, <i>unc-47</i> is a key component of my gene expression simulation project, as it allows for the visualization of how changes in inhibitory neurotransmission affect locomotion behaviors in C. elegans.

  <div class="genes-text-right">
      <p>
        The <i>eat-4</i> gene in C. elegans is located on chromosome I and encodes the Vesicular Glutamate Transporter (VGLUT), which is essential for excitatory neurotransmission. It is primarily expressed in glutamatergic neurons, where it facilitates the packaging of glutamate into synaptic vesicles before release into the synapse. This process is critical for various neural functions, including feeding behavior, locomotion, and sensory processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mutations in <i>eat-4</i>  impair glutamatergic signaling, leading to defects in pharyngeal pumping (feeding), mechanosensory responses, and foraging behavior, making it an important neurobehavioral gene. As glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter across species, <i>eat-4</i>  serves as a model for understanding excitatory signaling and its role in behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my gene expression simulation project,<i>eat-4</i>  is included to demonstrate how excitatory neurotransmission influences feeding behavior and locomotion, helping to illustrate the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in shaping neural function.

    <i>odr-10</i>
  </div>
  
  <div class="genes-text-left">
      <p>
        The <i>odr-10</i>  gene in C. elegans is located on chromosome V and encodes a G-protein-coupled odorant receptor (GPCR) that is essential for olfactory sensation. It is primarily expressed in the AWC olfactory neurons, where it detects volatile odorants, particularly diacetyl, a key attractant associated with bacterial food sources. This gene plays a crucial role in chemotaxis, enabling C. elegans to navigate toward favorable environments based on chemical cues. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Mutations in <i>odr-10</i> disrupt olfactory signaling, leading to defects in food-seeking behavior, impairing the wormâ€™s ability to locate bacterial food sources efficiently. As olfaction is tightly linked to survival and behavior, <i>odr-10</i> provides valuable insights into sensory processing and neural circuit function
      </p>
      <p>
        In my simulation project, <i>odr-10</i> is included to illustrate how sensory input, particularly odor detection, influences locomotion and feeding behavior, helping to model how environmental cues shape neural activity and decision-making in C. elegans.

  <div class="genes-text-right">
      <p>
        The <i>glr-1</i> gene in C. elegans is located on chromosome X and encodes an AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor, which is essential for excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. It is widely expressed in interneurons and motor neurons, where it mediates fast synaptic transmission by responding to glutamate release from presynaptic neurons. This gene plays a critical role in locomotion, mechanosensation, and learning-related behaviors by regulating excitatory signaling within neural circuits. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Mutations in <i>glr-1</i> impair glutamatergic transmission, leading to defects in movement coordination, sensory processing, and habituation to repeated stimuli, making it a key neurobehavioral gene. Since glutamate signaling is fundamental to nervous system function across species, <i>glr-1</i> serves as an important model for studying synaptic plasticity and behavioral modulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my simulation project, <i>glr-1</i> is included to demonstrate how excitatory neurotransmission influences locomotion and adaptive behaviors, helping to visualize the neural mechanisms underlying sensory-motor integration and behavioral flexibility in C. elegans.
